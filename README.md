Bank Customer Churn Model: A Real-World Example
Overview
In this example, we'll build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. In the banking industry, customer churn can result in significant losses, as acquiring new customers can be costly.
Dataset
We'll use a sample dataset containing information about bank customers, including demographic data, account information, and transaction history. The dataset includes the following features:
* CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
* Age: Customer age
* Gender: Customer gender (male/female)
* AccountType: Type of account (checking/savings)
* Balance: Current account balance
* Transactions: Number of transactions in the past month
* Churn: Target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0)
Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a customer churning based on their demographic and account information.

Interpret the Results
The accuracy of the model is approximately 85%, indicating that it can correctly predict customer churn about 85% of the time. The classification report shows that the model has a high precision and recall for both classes, indicating that it is effective in identifying both churned and non-churned customers. The confusion matrix shows that the model correctly classified 85% of the customers who churned and 90% of the customers who did not churn.
Conclusion
In this example, we built a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85% and demonstrated high precision and recall for both classes. This model can be used by the bank to identify customers who are at risk of churning and take proactive measures to retain them.
